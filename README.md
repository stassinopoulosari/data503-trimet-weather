# DATA503 Final Project (Initial)

**Ari Stassinopoulos** apstassinopoulos@willamette.edu

This repository contains the code for the initial attempt at my DATA503 final project. The aim of this code was to scrape TriMet data to use with OpenWeather data.

Required files:

You must create a `secrets.Makefile` file in the main directory with the following properties:

```Makefile
database_password := PLACEHOLDER # Here goes the password you create for your PostgreSQL database.
openweather_key := PLACEHOLDER # OpenWeather API Key
trimet_app_id := PLACEHOLDER # TriMet GTFS API key
```
